## Learning Objectives
Through this project, you'll learn:
1. **Firebase Integration**: Authentication, Firestore database, real-time updates
2. **State Management**: React Context API with useReducer pattern
3. **Authentication Flows**: Login, registration, password reset, protected routes
4. **Database Operations**: CRUD operations, real-time subscriptions
5. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first design with Tailwind CSS
